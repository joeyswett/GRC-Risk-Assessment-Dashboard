## Objective
I conducted a comprehensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) analysis to identify, assess, and mitigate organizational risks. This project highlights the improvements in risk levels after mitigation, demonstrating how I effectively reduced high-risk exposures and enhanced organizational resilience.

## Key Skills
- üìä Conducting detailed risk assessments.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Designing effective mitigation strategies.
- üîç Data analysis and visualization.
- üìÇ Categorizing risks across organizational domains.
- üöÄ Leveraging frameworks for GRC improvements.

## Tools
- **Excel**: For processing and organizing risk data.
- **Power BI**: To create visual representations of risks.
- **ISO 27001**: Framework I used to guide risk management best practices.

### 2. Conducting a Risk Assessment
![Risk Assessment Data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ae94b1d-7f72-4cd9-abc4-b42933d607ab)

*Raw risk data before mitigation, highlighting the areas I identified for analysis.*

**Description**: I conducted a hypothetical risk assessment to identify high-risk areas. The data table includes key risks categorized by their likelihood and potential impact. I analyzed each risk based on its category, mitigation plan, and status, which helped me prioritize actions effectively.

---

### 3. Pre-Mitigation Risk Matrix

*This matrix visually represents risk levels before I applied any mitigation efforts.*

**Description**: The pre-mitigation matrix revealed several high-risk areas that required immediate attention. This step emphasized the importance of implementing strategic interventions.

### 4. Mitigation Plan
![Mitigation Plan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43709241-3960-4729-99cd-aa2ac3a61861)

*This table outlines the mitigation strategies I developed for each identified risk.*

**Description**: I developed hypothetical mitigation strategies tailored to address the identified risks. These strategies reflect real-world practices I would implement, such as:
- Automating patch management.
- Conducting company-wide phishing simulations.
- Enforcing security contract requirements with vendors.
- Reviewing and updating firewall rules regularly.
- Implementing multi-factor authentication and robust backup plans.

### 5. Post-Mitigation Risk Matrix
![Post-Mitigation Matrix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26a4a93a-77ec-45e0-8483-b8e14f31c703)

*This matrix shows the risk levels after I applied my mitigation strategies.*

**Description**: The post-mitigation matrix demonstrated a significant reduction in high-risk levels, with many risks shifting to medium or low categories. This outcome highlighted the effectiveness of my strategies in reducing organizational risks.

---

### 6. Additional Insights
![Other Data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc2e699-5f33-4205-8bbd-6e5e92770f5d)

*This image shows the distribution of risks after mitigation and a comparison of risk levels before and after mitigation.*

**Description**: The pie chart provides a breakdown of risk levels after mitigation, showing that high risks were significantly reduced, while medium and low risks increased. The table compares the total number of risks before and after mitigation, highlighting an 80% reduction in high risks and a notable improvement in overall risk management. This analysis reflects the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation strategies.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Balancing Risk Categorization**: One challenge I faced was accurately categorizing risks while designing effective mitigation strategies. I overcame this by leveraging ISO 27001 principles and validating data through iterative processes.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Structured risk management enhances organizational resilience.
- Visualizing data helps stakeholders understand risk dynamics.
- Iterative mitigation strategies lead to measurable improvements in risk levels.
